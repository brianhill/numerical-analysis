### Week 10 &mdash; Distributions and Statistical Tests, Continued

* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 8 &mdash; [Problem Set 8](./assignments/PS08.nb.pdf) on Uniform and Binomial Distributions
* Tuesday, Nov. 8 &mdash; The Binomial Distribution
* Preparation for Friday, Nov. 11 &mdash; Study the [t-Test](./resources/StatisticalTests-t-Test.pdf) (from [JMP (maker of SAS)](https://www.jmp.com/en_us/statistics-knowledge-portal/t-test.html)) and the program on pp. 121-123 of the *HP-25 Applications Programs* book &mdash; Type in the program and do the example on p. 123 to make sure it works
* Friday, Nov. 11 &mdash; Discussion of paired t-Test

### Week 11 &mdash; Statistical Tests, Concluded &mdash; Numerical Methods: Root Finding (Newton's Method)

* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 15 &mdash; [Problem Set 9](./assignments/PS09.nb.pdf) &mdash; Study the [&chi;-Squared Test](./resources/StatisticalTests-ChiSquared.pdf) (also from [JMP (maker of SAS)](https://www.jmp.com/en_us/statistics-knowledge-portal/chi-square-test.html)) and the program on pp. 118-120 of the *HP-25 Applications Programs* book &mdash; Type in the program and do the example on p. 120 to make sure it works
* Tuesday, Nov. 15 &mdash; Discussion of &chi;-squared Test
* Friday, Nov. 18 &mdash; Class will prepare for and lead discussion of Newton's method &mdash; pp. 71-99 of Bill &amp; Dave (which takes us well into WWII)

### Week 12 &mdash; Numerical Methods: Differential Equations (Euler's Method)

*Makeup class on Sunday before Thanksgiving*

* Sunday, Nov. 20 &mdash; A look at some historical materials (old calculators and old Scientific American magazines)
* Preparation for Tuesday, Nov. 22 &mdash; In Chapter 5, study the program on pp. 83-84 &mdash; Problem Set 10: 1. Key in the program and make sure that the example works as expected. Then 1(a) Continue making the table from x = 0 to x = 5. That is 41 data points. 1(b) Graph the data accurately. This is not a very exciting function. 2. Alter the program to do the following equation: y'(x) = y * cos(x + y). The calculator needs to be in radians mode. The initial condition is y(0) = 1 instead of y(1) = 1. 2(a) Make a table of the resulting function from x = 0 to x = 10 (101 data points). (I'm not sure how well this will work if you increase the step size to 0.2 which would make it only 51 data points.) 2(b) Make a graph of the resulting function from x = 0 to x = 15. The vertical axis will need to go from about 0.0 to 1.25. This is a remarkable function.
* Tuesday, Nov. 22 &mdash; Discussion of differential equations and the theory of Euler's method.

### Week 13 &mdash; Numerical Methods: Integration (Simpson's Rule)

*Odd schedule this week due to Friday all-hands preg check*

* Tuesday, Nov. 29 &mdash; Introduction to Integrals and Simpson's Rule
* Preparation for Thursday, Dec. 1 &mdash; Complete [Problem Set 11](./assignments/PS11.nb.pdf) on differential equations
* Thursday, Dec. 1 &mdash; Proof of Simpson's Rule (Brian and Brandon) &mdash; Applications of Simpson's Rule

### Week 14 &mdash; Term 3 Exam &mdash; Special Projects

*Special Projects: Choose a program we have not worked through or extend a program that we have already worked through. Explain the theory. Illustrate it with examples. We will have four 15-minute presentations (I could do one too?) on the last day.*

* Tuesday, Dec. 6 &mdash; Term 3 Exam &mdash; There will be a statistics problem &mdash; There will be three more problems from which you will choose two: the three additional problems will be on Newton's method, on differential equations (Euler's method), and on integrals (Simpson's rule)
* Friday, Dec. 9 &mdash; Discuss and get started on special projects

### Week 15 &mdash; Present Special Projects

* Tuesday, Dec. 13 &mdash; Special Project presentations
